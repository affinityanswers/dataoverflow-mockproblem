# Data Overflow Mock Problem
Data overflow contest mock problem.
## Location Aggregation
We have a TSV(Tab Separated value) file containing user_id and location_id in each line, the goal of this task is to aggregate the user visitation into a output TSV file containing user_id and the location_ids in a single line without any duplicates

**Note** :  user_id and location_id are integers, user_id represents a user and location_id represents a location.

### Input File(s)
```
USER_ID LOCATION_ID
1234    1
1234    2
1245    6
1293    7
1234    4
1245    5
1293    4
2345    1
1234    1
```
  
### Output File
```
1234    1,2,4
1245    6,5
1293    7,4
2345    1
```
### How will your code be tested?
The code will be tested against test cases.

For performance we are testing the code with a file having 1 million records, 10 million records and 100 million records

**Expected Runtime** : Your code is expected to generate the output file for 1 million records within 5 seconds, 10 million within 50 seconds and 100 million within 500 seconds.

**Important Note** : While testing your code we will run your code with N files, 2 <= N <= 10. You can expect all the **N** files to be evenly divided with data.


### Hardware Requirement:
 1GB RAM, 2 core CPU
 
## Sample data
Sample data can be downloaded from [here](https://dataoverflow.affinityanswers.com/sample_data/mock_problem/data.zip)

This is a zip file, please uncompress it using a unzip command or simple uncompressing tool.

You can use this sample data to run your code.
